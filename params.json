It is a stocky and muscular carnivore, resembling a small bear. The wolverine has a reputation for endurance, ferocity, and strength out of proportion to its size, with the capacity to battle with competitors many times its size.\r\n\r\nGulo is also a VertNet project designed for harvesting Darwin Core Archives, shredding them into small pieces, and loading them into [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com). It's written in the [Clojure](http://clojure.org) programming language and rides on [Cascading](http://www.cascading.org) and [Cascalog](https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog) for processing \"Big Data\" on top of [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) using [MapReduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html).","note":"Don't delete this file!
